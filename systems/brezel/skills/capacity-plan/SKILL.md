name: capacity-plan
description: Plan resource capacity with workload analysis and utilization forecasting. Use when heading into quarterly planning, when the team feels overallocated and needs numbers, when deciding whether to hire or deprioritize, or when stress-testing whether upcoming projects fit the available people.

# Capacity Plan

Analyze team capacity and plan resource allocation.

## What I Need

- **Team size and roles**: Who is available?
- **Current workload**: What are they working on? (Cases and work items, records in this Brezel system found with the entity tools, or a description or export the user provides)
- **Upcoming work**: What's coming next quarter?
- **Constraints**: Budget, hiring timeline, skill requirements

Ask the user for anything you cannot find.

## Planning Dimensions

### People
- Available headcount and skills
- Current allocation and utilization
- Planned hires and timeline
- Contractor and vendor capacity

### Budget
- Operating budget by category
- Project-specific budgets
- Variance tracking
- Forecast vs. actual

### Time
- Project timelines and dependencies
- Critical path analysis
- Buffer and contingency planning
- Deadline management

## Utilization Targets

| Role Type | Target Utilization | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| IC / Specialist | 75-80% | Leave room for reactive work and growth |
| Manager | 60-70% | Management overhead, meetings, 1:1s |
| On-call / Support | 50-60% | Interrupt-driven work is unpredictable |

## Common Pitfalls

- Planning to 100% utilization (no buffer for surprises)
- Ignoring meeting load and context-switching costs
- Not accounting for vacation, public holidays, and sick time (in Germany typically 25-30 vacation days plus regional public holidays; working-time limits under the ArbZG apply)
- Treating all hours as equal (creative work ≠ admin work)

## Output

```markdown
## Capacity Plan: [Team/Project]
**Period:** [Date range] | **Team Size:** [X]

### Current Utilization
| Person/Role | Capacity | Allocated | Available | Utilization |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| [Name/Role] | [hrs/wk] | [hrs/wk] | [hrs/wk] | [X]% |

### Capacity Summary
- **Total capacity**: [X] hours/week
- **Currently allocated**: [X] hours/week ([X]%)
- **Available**: [X] hours/week ([X]%)
- **Overallocated**: [X people above 100%]

### Upcoming Demand
| Project/Initiative | Start | End | Resources Needed | Gap |
|--------------------|-------|-----|-----------------|-----|
| [Project] | [Date] | [Date] | [X FTEs] | [Covered/Gap] |

### Bottlenecks
- [Skill or role that's oversubscribed]
- [Time period with a crunch]

### Recommendations
1. [Hire / Contract / Reprioritize / Delay]
2. [Specific action]

### Scenarios
| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Do nothing | [What happens] |
| Hire [X] | [What changes] |
| Deprioritize [Y] | [What frees up] |
```

## Tips

1. **Include all work** — Day-to-day operations, projects, support, meetings. People aren't 100% available for project work.
2. **Plan for buffer** — Target 80% utilization. 100% means no room for surprises.
3. **Update regularly** — Capacity plans go stale fast. Review monthly.
